# LeadDev London 2024

## Day 1

### Keynote: Embracing engineering’s place at the forefront of business

- Leadership is key
- Tech Leaders may be leaders, but not only in tech anymore

### How do you deliver a feature on the biggest stage in the world?

- New learned term: Product Engineering: Working closely with customer.

### Engineering leadership in 2024 and beyond: Skating where the puck is going when the ice is melting

- Staff Engineer role as growth
- [Engineering Leadership Report 2024]](https://leaddev.com/sites/default/files/2024-06/LeadDev-Engineering-Leadership-Performance-Report-2024__LDMO__.pdf)
- When everyone is skating where the puck will go, where will you skate?

### Tech debt as innovation, reframing this forever problem as an opportunity

> Tech Debt is a **natural** byproduct of the software **innovation** lifecycle.

- Tech debt has a marketing problem.
- Principles and Definitions
  - Tech Debt: The delta between current and ideal state
  - What is not tech debt:
    - business decisions or strategy misalignment
    - lack of resource or tools
    - poor communication or cross-function
    - ...
  - Tech Debt Principles:
    - Be specific
    - Make it visible
    - Net reduce
    - Be proactive
    - Value long-term system health over low-impact feature access
    - Lean into the future
- Neglect is not a strategy
  - When you neglect it, it makes it worse
- Name it, Fund it
  - Invest with focus and resources like any other innovation area
- Centralized fleet-wide change management
  - One of the most senior engineers leading it
  - Tech wide impact
  - Number one problem: Knowledge
  - Confidence Chimp (from Chaos Monkey)
- Celebrate the wins, learn from the struggles
- Challenges:
  - Migration is often forgotten. The prototype is not a problem. It's a race against time.
  - Leaders change
  - Teams change
  - Business priorities change
  - The solution does simply not fulfill its promises
- Innovation Vehicle
  - Product Innovation <-> Debt Innovation
    - Better management
    - Better innovation
- Doing something about tech debt in different phases of a company:
  - Founding: survive
  - Product-market-fit: Automate
  - Scaling: do both
  - Steady: unlock
  - Mega corp: Pick hard over easy
- If we manage our debt better, it's so we can say yes to the business more.

### From overload to oasis: Creating more time for the cool stuff

> Your boring is someone else's cool.

- Ask what is my cool? Make more space for it.

### Managing across timezones; A retrospective

- Have dedicated time when everyone is working "Golden Hours"
- Experiment with processes
- Async first: Write Documentation (plus ADRs and RFCs)
- Empower (make a framework that covers only necessary things, and then get out of the way)
- Embrace timezones -> turn it into strength
- Retrospect regularly

### Building for the new developer

- Rockstar devs are just born geniuses?
- The Brilliance Trap
  - Field-specific ability beliefs: beliefs we hold about what success requires in a certain field - can be **inaccurate**.
  - These can interact with pre-existing biases about **who is brilliant**.
  - **Feels** positive
  - Contests fuel brilliance beliefs
- 4 key psychological targets for thriving
  - Learning culture — shared, not just individual
  - Agency — devs shall have agency in decisions
  - Belonging — even if someone is different, they belong
  - Self-efficacy & motivation — even if I encounter difficulty, I will overcome it
- How to achieve brilliance? Two options:
  - Contest culture
    - -> More Imposterism
    - -> People feel AI Skill Threat
  - Thriving culture
    - -> less people fear AI skill threat
- Modelling Thriving Culture
  - Learning culture influences Belonging & Team effectiveness
  - Belonging influences Productivity & Team effectiveness
  - Productivity influences Team effectiveness
  - -> Focus on Learning Culture. It drives the others.
- Takeaways
  - The brilliance trap -> fueled by contest cultures in technical spaces
  - Beliefs about the future -> developers are facing high rates of AI skill threat
  - Beliefs about ability -> Thriving cultures driver better outcomes for **both** wellbeing, **and** productivity and team effectiveness.
  - -> Our psychological system can create resilience in our teams.

### Demystifying neurodiversity in tech with nostalgic video games

- When we think divergently, we think in multiple directions, seek information and consider all of the sides of the issue.
- Team members should be accommodated to their needs, because they are human.
  - 4+2 is six, but so is 3+3. There are multiple ways to get to outcomes.
- Process:
  1. Validate with others (not validate the neurodiversity, but validate the above statement with them)
  2. Educate the team
  3. Mitigate proactively: more transparent and more upfront of what people need to do their best work.
     - how do you want to give updates
     - how to you want feedback
     - ...
- Proactively implement transparency on ways of working of communicating using a "Work with me" manual
- -> Address the elephant in the room
- -> Helps take the pressure off
- -> Remove barriers and conflicts.
- -> It's not about perfection, it's about progress.

### How to use technology radars to make transparent tech decisions

- Tool: https://www.aoe.com/techradar/
  - https://github.com/AOEpeople/aoe_technology_radar
- Good for:
  - Valuable and fun conversations
  - Onboarding & hiring
  - Alignment
  - Tech stack skills coverage
  - Strengths and vulnerabilities
- Caveats:
  - takes time
  - update openly and regularly

### Delivery metrics - the good, the bad and the utterly ridiculous

- DORA is great, but the graphs don't mean much on their own.
- Basic questions & What can we measure to answer these questions:
  - What are we building?
  - How are we building it?
- Proposed Metrics
  - Velocity (number of tickets completed in sprint) -> towards consistency and predictability
  - Proportion of tickets that are sprint goal related.
  - Sprint completion

### Measure for change

- Every measure should be getting us to getting better.
- If we don't improve, we need to change the way we measure.
- Better software faster or worse software slower -> seems obvious which option to choose.
- Activities to improve developer productivity:
  - involve your team
  - tie data to decisions
  - always follow up
- Measurements
  - Quantitative: Data available, not actionable, objective
  - Qualitative: Hard to do right (design, participation, ...), is actionable, holistic
  - Myth: quantitative data is more important than qualitative data
    - Software is made by humans for humans
    - False perception: Opinions aren't truth.
    - Actual: Quantitative data lies to us all the time.
      - You can only measure what you think to measure.
      - False sense of security through lack of data.
      - Without intermediary metrics stakeholders may think that a year with no outages is evidence that the system is high quality.
  - We need something **permeable** to co-adapts with our teams.
  - Your teams know where the problems are.
  - Qualitative data is a **key factor** of improving developer productivity.
- Do:
  - Put problem sentiment and priority into context with workflow data.
  - Quarterly survey
  - Take action on insights
