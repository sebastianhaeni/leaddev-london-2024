### Making smart investments: A framework for maximizing your ROI in technical decisions

- ROI = (Gain from investment - Cost from investment) / Cost from investment
  - Cost = Time + Money
  - Gain = You have to define it. (which brings in Bias)
- Factors to investigate to make good decisions:
  - Potential: impact on user experience, potential revenue increase, operational efficiency, alignment with strategic goals
    - Direct metrics: operational, cost savings, user engagement, conversion rates, adoption rates
    - Proxy metrics: link goal metrics to other metrics easier to measure
  - Risks: technical limitations, resource budget constraints, performance constraints, data privacy / security compliance
    - Guardrail metrics: system reliability, uptime, response time, exposure points, data sensitivity, data durability, budget variance
  - Involvement: identify your partners, find the right incentives, recognize the dependencies with other teams.
    - Effective collaboration: can you collaborate? What processes are needed? Do partners have the bandwidth?
  - Skills: required skills and expertise, tools and infrastructure, identify necessary knowledge for execution, estimate the time required, determine the number of experts needed.
    - Assess capability: Performance metrics, willingness to learn, resources & availability
  - Motivation: evaluate potential team growth, assess their commitment and excitement, measure the decision's impact on team morale.
    - Gauge motivation: 1:1, team career growth goals, satisfaction surveys.
- New definitions:
  - Gain = Potential + Motivation + Skills
  - Cost = Risks + Involvement

### The boss's shoes don't fit: And other surprises of leadership

- Speak less:
  - You're not the most knowledgeable person in the room
  - Your words will be amplified
  - -> Listen more
  - OK Reasons to say something:
    - Be part of brainstorming
    - Ask about details that your leadership will question you
- Speak more:
  - Explain the way you're thinking
  - Explain why it's important
  - Be curious (i.e. this is not a call to action, I just want to know)
  - Diffuse the situation (explain it like I'm a 5 year old)
  - Share information (be generous, you'in many meetings people are not, connect the dots)
- 5:1 rule: Ideal positive to negative feedback ratio. ([Emily Heaphy, Marcial Losada, 2004](https://www.factorhappiness.at/downloads/quellen/S8_Losada.pdf))
- Be a storyteller
  - Accomplishments don't speak for themselves
  - Why what we do is important and hard
  - -> One sentence (maybe elevator pitch)
- Celebrate
  - Ack' and admire what people do, did more than asked and overcame obstacles.
  - Thank people
  - Prizes, bonuses, awards
  - "Just" credit is also fine

### Uncertainty of change

- We react with Excitement or Fear. And it's a fine line triggered by change in the environment.
- Fear reactions: Fight, Flight, Freeze or Faun
- By being more aware of our environment, change will have less impact on us.
  - Humility — We don't have all the answers.
  - Empathy — We need to support each other.
  - Curiosity — There eis always more to learn (blogs, books, meetups, ... are not sufficient)
    - [Cynefin Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework): Differentiate between complex and complicated
      - Complicated: Not simple but knowable. I.e. code.
      - Complex: Also not simple, but never fully knowable. They have emergent behavior. I.e. software.
- Don't ask how to do more testing — ask how to reduce uncertainty.
  - There are no best practices.
  - We have good practices:
    - Probe, Sense & Respond

### Managing the marathon: Leading teams through lengthy migration projects

- Who - Audience Personas
  - Patrons
  - Consumers
  - Builders
- What
  - Size
  - Time

    - Integration Point Milestones
    - Capability Milestones
  - Metrics

    - Celebrated
    - Gamified
    - Motivation
    - Regular Communication
    - Metrics have their limits to communicate nuanced information.
  - We need Milestones & Metrics to communicate.

-> Tell a story

### How to set goals with people who don’t want to set goals

Steps:

- Braindumping -> Post its
  - Set the scene
  - Think big, think small (Do you want to be CTO?, You want to improve error handling?)
  - Include personal life
  - Use past conversation
- Mapping -> Whiteboard
  - Talk them through
  - Create a timeline (next, later, future)
  - Add dependencies
- Shaping
  - Pick 2 or 3
  - Transform into SMART goals or OKRs
  - Ask how until something actionable turns up
  - Some goals can become a focus
  - Some goals can be opportunity based (circumstancal, advocatal)
- Review & Repeat: Reflect and revisit
  - What have we accomplished?
  - What didn't fit?
  - What can we add to the backlog?
  - What should we pick up?
- Outcomes
  - Three really legit goals/focuses
  - Career direction
  - Personal aspirations
  - Backlog of goals

### If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem

- Non Violent Communication
  - Observation: When I see that...
  - Feelings: I feel ...
  - Needs: because my need for... is/is not met.
  - Request: Would you be willing to ...?

### Mentorship + sponsorship

- What did career changing people do to someone?
  - shared advice / perspective
  - lightbulb moment
  - challenging feedback
  - threw me into the deep end
- coaching: for internal growth
- mentoring: perfect for unblocking or onboarding

> Mentors give perspective, sponsors give opportunity.

- Finding a sponsor

  1. Do great work
  2. Find someone who knows you and your work
  3. Know how you want to grow (be specific, that can be backed up with action)
  4. Keep them updated

- You can also be there for your sponsor
